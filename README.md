## Improvements with double the time:

- The Dark Sky API is no longer free to use as of March 30th so I wasted some time trying to find a different one. I tried one that didn't fit the needs of the project
  and then found the one I went with but I don't think it's very good so I definitely would have liked to do more research and use a better weather API.
- I considered using something like Heroku to host the backend but I figured that would take too much time and be outside of the scope of the project and in the end
  decided to just combine them.
- The styling looks pretty bad and would have gotten more attention.
- With more time I think features such as filtering by date to narrow down specific incidents would have been something worth adding.

## Time spent on project:

- Somewhere between 5 and 6 hours.
